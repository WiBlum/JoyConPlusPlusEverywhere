# JoyCon++

An open-source C++ library for interfacing with Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers (Joy-Con 1 and Joy-Con 2) on Windows, Linux and MacOS (Apple Silicon & Intel Macs)

# DISCLAIMER

This repo is a fork to remade the whole thing all the way up using others api than the proprietary one from Microsoft on Windows that is Useless on Linux and Mac as the same way they don't have any driver for, maybe it would work fine under wine or many patches/fixes, but certainly don't want those, so why don't we reco from the begining the whole thing just use the [hidapi universal library](https://github.com/libusb/hidapi) instead of the WinAPI HID one ?

Q&A :
- So, this fork is now alive, but does it works ?
  - No it doesn't work at this moment, I'm alone on this project, I doesn't have that much time to code on it and I never code a real working software that is usefull other than little games, you can see me like a lil'baby in code ;)

- Can I contribute to that project ? And How ?
  - Hey, Welcome buddy, no matter the thing you want to had, if it's a fix for a Platform you have, a request like 'help it keeps crashing' or anything else, no worries it's ok we're all here to try our best in contributing on this project, if you're a professional writer in C++ or else and you want to add some, do it so, you're so much welcome, for the other who's just passing by or simply to test it on your own hardware/os, you're welcome too !

- When could we see a working/stable release of it ?
  -  Hmm, I don't know when or how it would work if we ever make a working release. I honestly fork the project just because I'm frustrated to see that much of people who don't care about their software, how does it work or is my data is protected, yes I agree I only want to install software that runs and do what it was built for, currently Joycon++ (JoyconPlusPlus) is working on Windows, rewriting the whole thing that works with Microsoft Proprietary Api's to a universal Api isn't something that sound easy, and it never have to be easy, I can't tell you when it would work, but there's a high change that in a near future in some months (maybe week if it's not that much difficult) that a Alpha or Beta release of it see the bright light of days on earth. Stay tuned.

> This is the end of the disclaimer, the rest of the README.md at this point stay untouched for the moment, if it needs some edits for specific hardware or os, I'll do.

## Overview üéÆ

**JoyCon++** provides a foundation for developers and researchers interested in low-level interaction with Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons, supporting both Bluetooth Classic (Joy-Con 1) and Bluetooth Low Energy (Joy-Con 2).

- **Joy-Con 1** devices require manual Bluetooth pairing to appear as HID devices on Windows. Although full Joy-Con 1 support isn‚Äôt the initial focus of the first commit, it is supported through the `JoyCon` class in `joycon.cpp`. This class can be instantiated by passing the vendor ID, product ID, and serial number obtained from HID enumeration, enabling direct reading and writing of input reports. Implementing Joy-Con 1 functionality is straightforward with this approach.

- **Joy-Con 2** devices broadcast BLE advertisements when the sync button is held. JoyCon++ scans for these advertisements, allowing users to select and connect to a device and subscribe to the correct BLE characteristics. However, input notifications from Joy-Con 2 have not been successfully received yet despite subscribing, making this the current main focus for further development and experimentation.

---

## Current Functionality

- Scans for Joy-Con 1 devices via HID enumeration (requires manual pairing beforehand).
- Scans and detects Joy-Con 2 devices broadcasting BLE advertisements during sync mode.
- Enables connecting and subscribing to BLE characteristics on Joy-Con 2.
- Includes a `JoyCon` class for Joy-Con 1 input report handling (not fully integrated yet).

---

## Intended Use and Design

The goal is to provide an open framework for anyone interested in exploring, decoding, or building on Joy-Con input data. JoyCon++ is primarily a developer tool and research project rather than a finished user-facing product.

- Each Joy-Con is treated as an individual device with its own inputs and sensors.
- The library does **not** combine inputs or provide shared controls out of the box.
- This approach allows developers to build custom logic for combining or processing multiple controllers however they see fit.
- The library supports connecting multiple Joy-Cons independently, which is useful for advanced use cases (e.g., motion-controlled games using several controllers per player, requiring seperate gyro and accelerometer values).

---

## Quirks and Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- For **Joy-Con 1 (HID)**, ensure the device is fully paired and connected before scanning. The Joy-Con light should be solid, otherwise the device won't appear in HID enumeration.
- For **Joy-Con 2 (BLE)**, devices show up when broadcasting advertisements such as when pressing buttons, but you must hold the sync button for pairing mode before connecting and subscribing.
- The `joycon.cpp` file is included to assist with Joy-Con 1 input decoding and may be useful for Joy-Con 2 research, but it was not the focus of the initial implementation.
- Full Joy-Con 1 support through HID input reading is possible with the current codebase but requires additional integration work.

---

## Dependencies and Environment

- Tested on Windows 10 64-bit with Visual Studio.
- Relies on Windows Runtime APIs and HIDAPI.
- No external package manager required but developers may need to ensure Windows SDK and appropriate runtime components are installed.

## Contributing ü§ù

- Experiment freely with the code and your own implementations.
- Document what works and what doesn‚Äôt.
- This project focuses on building a foundation to decode and handle Joy-Con 2 inputs; Joy-Con 1 support is secondary but present.
- Raise issues or pull requests on GitHub to share your findings or improvements.
- Open to collaboration for completing and improving this library.

## Summary

JoyCon++ is an experimental and open toolset for working with Joy-Con controllers on Windows at a low level, aimed at developers and hobbyists interested in custom input handling, research, and new ways of interfacing with these devices.
